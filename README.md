I wanted to start working with the Golang and created this project to test what I learn. 

The steps I took: 

- Reuse an existing template site and grunt build file as the "template" for ra.go. 

- Create a type struct { string } to demonstrate one way to pass data to a template

- Upload to Go App Engine with the provided SDK

- Demonstrate different versions revised over 24hours

Version 1 : http://1.automatic-bot-91805.appspot.com/</br>
Version 2 : http://2.automatic-bot-91805.appspot.com/</br>
Version 3 : http://3.automatic-bot-91805.appspot.com/</br>
Version 4 : http://4.automatic-bot-91805.appspot.com/</br>
Version 5 : http://5.automatic-bot-91805.appspot.com/</br>

The Golang was very easy to get started working with. As you can see from the demonstrations above, I was quickly able to convert an existing website into a Go template that displays data.
