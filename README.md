In this project you will find a very basic GoApp which I created to share some of my work. The website itself is just a directory with links pointing to source files and live previews. I find it difficult to house and share my work from a visually appealing place because the work I do is in so many different areas that it became impossible to have one website where I could show all of my work. I have seen other developer website and while they are beautiful, they have a sort of bloggy feel to them and I want to avoid that. Since the reason for this site to exist in the first place is just to point other peole to my work and share a little bit about myself, a plain text website is perfect for my needs. It is also very easy to maintain a plain text website, but for regular business this would be very unprofessional.
