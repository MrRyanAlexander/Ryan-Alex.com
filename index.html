        <h4>Welcome to my website</h4></br><p>I created this site to have a place to share links to my work and a little bit about myself. I am a Junior/Entry level programmer. I started programming in Dec 2012 and have continued to pursue the journey ever since that first, "Hello World!". Someone introduced me to <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/pMinus">Codecademy</a> back in 2012 and I thoroughly enjoyed going through each language course that was available at the time; they have added more.</br></br>After finishing the courses at Codecademy, I went on to start working on my own ideas. I spend a lot of my time creating random projects for both experience and to explore ideas I have. The devloper tools in the browser really came in handy and I build a habit of checking the source code for some of the websites I visit on a regular basis. Actually that led me to ask even more questions and that is probably why I became curious about things like, "how are they making their Javascript look like that?"; Uglify! I started working with Yeoman and the grunt build tools shortly thereafter too.</br></br>In the summer of 2013 I took a Coursea class entitled, "Startup Engineering". The class was fast pasted and being half startup half engineering we got to listen to founders and investors as well as get hands on experience working with AWS, Git, Emacs and more. For the rest of 2013 I kept building projects by trying out new frameworks.</br></br>Early in 2014 I started writing Java and Obj-C. I fell in love with Obj-C and quickly joined the iOS Developer Program. I was using a WM to access xCode up to this point and bought an iPhone and Macbook to continue pursuing Obj-C code targeting iOS. In the summer of 2014, I submitted a <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bloxz2d/id900677675?mt=8">game</a> to test the whole process of app submission to the App Store and it was accepted a few days later.</br></br>I continue to practice with Obj-C by making more apps and games. Some of my projects start from tutorials, some are just raw ideas I have one night that ended becoming working prototypes the next day. I am still learning the processes involved in properly developing and testing applications and will continue learning for many years to come. I am a great team player. Most of the people I have worked with at my various jobs have always come to me for help. I am sort of obsessive compulsive about the way certain things need to be and that is reflected in some of my work. I strive to write beautiful code, concise explanations and valuable products.</p> 

        Thank You for taking the time to read this, I hope to hear from you.
